# Setup

	echo "user:pass" > ftp-users.txt

Problems

* Logging (ftp, httpd, move ops) to an external server
* Monitoring / testing it's actually working
* Managing disk space archives ... deleting stuff after 90 days?
* Maybe put images and videos in seperate directories
* Better Web interface than the directory listing
* How to manage user / password accounts better
